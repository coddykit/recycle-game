// Docket Day — wow moments for the in-app review ask (fleet §12; the kit's CoddyReview / ReviewGate decide WHEN: first
// session ok, ≥ 240 s real play, never in the guide / a window / the background, ≤ 3 asks ≥ 30 days apart, OS sheet only,
// no "do you like it" card, nothing given for a rating). This class only says WHICH moments are wow moments:
//   * a won hearing (the guide's first hearing is a sure win at ~3-4 minutes: deferred to the moment the guide ends);
//   * a great day report (≥ 7 of 9 stars);   * the firm moved up a chapter.
// A moment that happens inside the guide is deferred to the first moment after it (Deferred, kept in settings).
